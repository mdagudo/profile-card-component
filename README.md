## My process

This is my first challenge from Frontend Mentor and I was a little confused at the beginning, but after some days researching and learning, I figured this out! I struggled a lot with the background, it was so silly but I got stucked in it and I did it at the end. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
